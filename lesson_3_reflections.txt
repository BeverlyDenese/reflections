Question 1: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Response: You would especially want to use a remote repository if you you had many collaborators working with you.

Question 2: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Response: If other people are working on the file you may not necessarily want to incorporate their changes.

Question 3: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Response:
          Fork - create a copy of a repository in the cloud
          clones- create a copy of a repository in the the cloud or create a copy of a repository by pulling it from the cloud to your               local machine
          branch - a side path on a local repository
